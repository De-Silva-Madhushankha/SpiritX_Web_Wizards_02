# SpiritX_Web_Wizards_02

## Project Overview

SpiritX_Web_Wizards_02, also known as **Spirit11**, is a fantasy cricket league web application that allows users to create their dream teams from real university players, analyze statistics, and compete for the top spot on the leaderboard. The project consists of an **Admin Panel**, a **User Interface**, and an **AI Chatbot (Spiriter)** to assist users with team selection and player insights.

## Instructions to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- pnpm (v6 or higher)
- MongoDB (for database)

### Client Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
    ```sh
    cd client
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Start the client development:
    ```sh
    pnpm run dev
    ```

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
    ```sh
    cd server
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values as needed.
    - You need a gemini API key and a MongoDB connection string

4. Add sample data to the database (optional):
    
    ```sh
    node addSampleDataToDB.js
    ```

5. Start the server:
    ```sh
    pnpm run start
    ```

6. The server will be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

**Note** Depending on your setup and development environment, ports might vary. Please make sure to update cors policies (at server.js), VITE_BASE_URL(at client .env)


## Database Setup & Configuration

### MongoDB Setup

1. Install MongoDB and start the MongoDB server.

2. Create a new database for the project.

3. Update the MongoDB connection string in the `.env` file:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
    ```

### Importing Sample Data

1. Ensure MongoDB is running.

2. Run the script to add sample data to the database:
    ```sh
    node addSampleDataToDB.js
    ```

- **Smart Responses:** If a detail is unavailable in the dataset, the bot responds with: “I don’t have enough knowledge to answer that question.”
- **Restricted Information:** Player points are never revealed to users.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- Users create an account and receive an **initial budget of Rs.9,000,000**.
- Players must be selected **only from the provided dataset**.
- A team consists of **11 players**, and total team points are calculated based on predefined logic.
- Users earn points based on player performance and compete on the leaderboard.
- CRUD operations apply **only to newly created players**, ensuring the dataset remains unchanged.

## Assumptions Made During Development

- The client and server will run on different ports (`3000` for the client and `5000` for the server).
- MongoDB is used as the primary database.
- Environment variables are managed using a `.env` file.
- The project uses pnpm for package management.

## Additional Features

- **Authentication**: Implemented using JWT tokens.
- **ChatBot**: A chatbot feature to assist users.
- **Player Management**: CRUD operations for managing players.
